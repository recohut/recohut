  "description": "Nodes in networks could be organized based on communities they belong to (i.e., homophily); in other cases, the organization could be based on the structural roles of nodes in the network (i.e., structural equivalence). For instance, in the below figure, we observe nodes $u$ and $s1$ belonging to the same tightly knit community of nodes, while the nodes $u$ and $s6$ in the two distinct communities share the same structural role of a hub node. Real-world networks commonly exhibit a mixture of such equivalences.",
