  "description": "GAT stands for Graph Attention Networks. This is a special GNN model that addresses several key challenges of spectral models, such as poor ability of generalization from a specific graph structure to another and sophisticated computation of matrix inverse. GAT utilizes attention mechanisms to aggregate neighborhood features (embeddings) by specifying different weights to different nodes.",
