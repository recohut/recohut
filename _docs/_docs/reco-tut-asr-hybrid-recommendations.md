<!-- #region -->
- Each algorithm has strenghts and weakness. So we can combine them
- Example, blend collaborative filtering with popularity: make sure people get relevant items for them AND try to make sure they will like it


- Means of Hibidrization:
    - Combine Items Scores
    
    Linear Blends or feature weighting linear scaling (as more ratings an item has, the less emphasis is put on a content based and more weight to the rank of the collaborative filtering is given for example)
    - Combine Item Ranks: Combina based on Output, not score
    - Integrated Models
    
- Advanced Models:
    - Conditionally Switch Models
    - Deep Integration (Putting content based computations inside a collaborative filtering)
    
- Matrix Factorization on Hibrid Data - SVD++ or SVDFeatures? No ideas..

- Netflix Challenge - Crazy stuff not real for real life

- Learning to Rank - FunkSVD for example
     - How do we generalise this idea?
