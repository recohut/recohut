  "description": "Markov chains, named after Andrey Markov, are mathematical systems that hop from one \"state\" (a situation or set of values) to another. For example, if you made a Markov chain model of a baby's behavior, you might include \"playing,\" \"eating\", \"sleeping,\" and \"crying\" as states, which together with other behaviors could form a 'state space': a list of all possible states. In addition, on top of the state space, a Markov chain tells you the probability of hopping, or \"transitioning,\" from one state to any other state---e.g., the chance that a baby currently playing will fall asleep in the next five minutes without crying first.",
