So, a personalized model that recommends the right item to the right user at the right time is the key to building such a model.

Collaborative filtering (CF) is considered as the most basic, mature, popular, and the easiest of methods to find recommendations based on historical reviews of user and item interactions. Simon Funk published a detailed implementation of a regularized matrix factorization (MF) based collaborative filtering approach, known as \u201cFunk SGD\u201d in his blog. Paterek introduced a bunch of novel techniques, including MF with biases, applying kernel ridge regression on the residual of MF, linear model for each item, and asymmetric factor models for collaborative filtering. Zhou et al. and Fredrickson have described the Alternating Least Squares (ALS) algorithm to address the performance bottlenecks associated with the Gradient Descent (SGD) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) based approaches for MF. Collaborative recommender systems have been implemented in different application areas. GroupLens is a news-based architecture employing collaborative methods in assisting users to locate articles from massive news database. Content-based filtering (CBF) recommends items based on the similarity between the preferences of the current user (properties of items already investigated by the user) and item properties extracted from item descriptions. Incorporating contextual information in a recommender system helps to get a clearer picture of the situation of any individual, place or object, which is of relevance to the system for prediction. Knowledge-based recommendation attempts to suggest objects based on inferences about a user\u2019s needs and preferences. Hybrid recommender systems combine two or more filtering techniques in different ways to increase the accuracy and performance of recommender systems. These techniques combine multiple filtering approaches in order to harness their strengths while leveling out their corresponding weaknesses. One of the first was Fab, which incorporated a combination of CF, to find users having similar website preferences, with CBF to find websites with similar content. The work of Burke was one of the first qualitative surveys on hybrid recommender systems, which can be classified, based on their operations, into weighted hybrid, mixed hybrid, switching hybrid, feature combination hybrid, cascade hybrid, feature-augmented hybrid and meta-level hybrid."),(0,m.kt)("h2",{id:"key-factors-to-consider"},"Key factors to consider"),(0,m.kt)("p",null,"Some of the many factors to consider include:"),(0,m.kt)("ul",null,(0,m.kt)("li",{parentName:"ul"},"What business goals and metrics are used to evaluate the effectiveness of the system?
