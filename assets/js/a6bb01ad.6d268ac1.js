Models"),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"In the early stage of recommendation systems, people spent much time on tedious and onerous feature engineering. At that time, the dimensions of the raw features are relatively small, which makes it possible to implement different combinations of raw features. The newly created features are then fed into a shallow model, such as Logistic Regression (LR) and Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (GBDT) are widely used in CTR prediction. Then, Factorization Machine (FM) transforms the learning of users and items features into a small, shared vector shape. Based on the above method, Field-aware and Field-weighted FM (FFM) further consider the different impact of the fields that a feature belongs to in order to improve the performance of CTR prediction. Along this line, Attentional Factorization Machines (AFM) are proposed to automatically learn weights of deep cross-features and Neural Factorization Machines (NFM) enhances FMs by modelling higher-order and non-linear feature interactions."),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"Recently, the success of deep neural networks (DNN) in natural language processing and computer vision brings a new direction to the recommendation system. Among them, the Wide & Deep learning introduces deep neural networks to the CTR prediction. It jointly trains a deep neural network along with the traditional wide linear model. The deep neural networks liberated people from feature engineering while generalizing better combinations of the features. Lots of variants of the Wide & Deep learning have been proposed since it revolutionizes the development of the CTR prediction. Deep & Cross network (DCN) replaces the wide linear part with cross-network, which generates explicit feature crossing among low and high level layers. DeepFM combines the power of DNN and factorization machines for feature representation in the recommendation system. Furthermore, xDeepFM extends the work of DNN by proposing a Compressed Interaction Network to enumerate and compress all feature interactions. Overall, the deep models mentioned above all construct a similar model structure by combing the low-order and high-order features, which greatly reduce the effort of feature engineering and improve the performance of CTR prediction."),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"However, these aforementioned shallow or deep models take statistical and categorical features as input, while discarding the sequential behavior information of users. For example, users may search items at an e-commerce system, then view some items of interest, and these items are likely to be clicked or purchased next time. Since the historical behaviors explicitly indicate the preference of the users, it has gained much more attention in the recommendation systems. Among them, DIN proposes a local activation unit that learns the dynamic user interests from the sequential behavior features. DIEN designs an interest evolving layer an attentional update gate to model the dependency between sequential behaviors. The researches above realized the importance of user\u2019s historical behaviors. Unfortunately, they just project other information (i.e., user-specific and context) into one vector and did not pay equal attention to the interactions between the candidate item and fine-grained information, while modeling this interaction has shown extensively progress in many tasks, such as search recommendations and knowledge distillation."),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"Different from all previous methods, MIAN can explore the sequential behavior and other fine-grained information simultaneously.
