  "description": "SASRec stands for Self-Attentive Sequential Recommendation. It relies on the sequence modeling capabilities of self-attentive neural networks to predict the occurence of the next item in a user’s consumption sequence. To be precise, given a user 𝑢 and their time-ordered consumption history $S^𝑢 = (S1^u, S2^u, \\dots, S_{|S^u|}^𝑢),$ SASRec first applies self-attention on $S^𝑢$ followed by a series of non-linear feed-forward layers to finally obtain the next item likelihood.",
