Without any user-dependent information, the only information that SRSs can utilize is the chronologically-ordered item sequence in each session which implies the short-term interest of user. Accordingly, some existing methods focus on how to effectively modeling the information in each single session. For example, GRU4Rec uses GRU which takes the embeddings of items in a session as input, to model the sequential patterns in the session. NARM summarizes the hidden states of GRU using an attention module, to model the user\u2019s main purpose and sequential patterns in the session. STAMP incorporates each item information in a session according to its similarity to the last item based on an attention mechanism, to focus on the most recent interest. SASRec uses a self-attention network to capture the user\u2019s preference within a sequence. SR-GNN, which is the first attempt to express the sessions in directed graphs, captures the complex transitions of items in a session via graph neural networks. FGNN introduces an attentional layer and a new readout function in graph neural networks to consider the latent order rather than the chronological item order in a session. RepeatNet first predicts whether the next item will be a repeat consumption or a new item, and then predicts the next item for each case. GRec leverages future data as well when learning the preferences for target items in a session for richer information in dilated convolutional neural networks. However, these methods cannot consider the relationships between sessions, as they use only the information within a single session. To overcome this limitation, some recent methods define the relationships between sessions using the item co-occurrence between them. CSRM incorporates information of the latest few sessions according to their similarity to the current session. CoSAN extends CSRM to find out the similar sessions for each item, not for each session. GCE-GNN, which shows the state-of-the-art recommendation performance, constructs a global graph that models pairwise item-transitions over sessions."),(0,i.kt)("p",null,(0,i.kt)("img",{loading:"lazy",alt:"/img/content-concepts-raw-session-based-recommenders-untitled-8.png",src:a(93621).Z,width:"1162",height:"616"})))}d.isMDXComponent=!0},69690:function(e,t,a){t.Z=a.p+"assets/images/content-concepts-raw-session-based-recommenders-untitled-1-26801f978540cd6fe829e1762d428729.png"},84484:function(e,t,a){t.Z=a.p+"assets/images/content-concepts-raw-session-based-recommenders-untitled-2-205643e887b3c1046740589270bf41a2.png"},23144:function(e,t,a){t.Z=a.p+"assets/images/content-concepts-raw-session-based-recommenders-untitled-3-ae96d367af14d085e3e13f72a2b50c97.png"},11334:function(e,t,a){t.Z=a.p+"assets/images/content-concepts-raw-session-based-recommenders-untitled-4-3061abc4ed2a476171edf6b0dfa03e40.png"},87753:function(e,t,a){t.Z=a.p+"assets/images/content-concepts-raw-session-based-recommenders-untitled-5-bd6a9c5ac985f1f8bbaae8bbe33294c7.png"},28548:function(e,t,a){t.Z=a.p+"assets/images/content-concepts-raw-session-based-recommenders-untitled-6-e9f396335e8ea97a2bde9a7d1fb83ee5.png"},84832:function(e,t,a){t.Z=a.p+"assets/images/content-concepts-raw-session-based-recommenders-untitled-7-6bd4da9ef7ee16914f5973ca1428d699.png"},93621:function(e,t,a){t.Z=a.p+"assets/images/content-concepts-raw-session-based-recommenders-untitled-8-ebd1ecfa194fff376eb52a3779988e32.png"},52610:function(e,t,a){t.Z=a.p+"assets/images/content-concepts-raw-session-based-recommenders-untitled-3806775b9d8e607609b0eaac381c954c.png"}}]);
