The predictions are built upon the existing ratings of other users who have similar ratings as the target user. However, such systems cannot handle new users (user cold-start) and new items (item cold-start) because of the lack of user-item interactions. Content-based systems are introduced to solve the cold-start problem. Such systems use user profile information (e.g., gender, nationality, religion, and political stance) and the contents of the items to make recommendations. The systems might have a limitation suggesting the same items to the users who have similar contents regardless of items that user already rated. Hybrid systems, which are based on a collaborative filter and utilize content information, are widely used in various applications. However, these systems are unfit for a recommendation when the user-item interaction data are sparse. Moreover, due to privacy issues, collecting personal information is challenging, which might result in the user cold-start problem. To avoid the user cold-start problem due to privacy issues, many web-based systems, such as Netflix, recommend items based on only minimal user information. Netflix initially presents popular movies and television programs to new users: we call these videos the evidence candidates. Then, the user chooses the videos that he/she likes among the candidates. Afterward, the system recommends some programs based on the videos selected by the user.

However, such an optimisation strategy can lead to biased results toward already popular items by frequently handling new items as negative instances. In this study, we tackle the cold-start problems for new users/items by appropriately leveraging unobserved samples. We propose a knowledge graph (KG)-aware recommender based on graph neural networks, which augments labelled samples through pseudo-labelling. Our approach aggressively employs unobserved samples as positive instances and brings new items into the spotlight. To avoid exhaustive label assignments to all possible pairs of users and items, we exploit a KG for selecting probably positive items for each user. We also utilise an improved negative sampling strategy and thereby suppress the exacerbation of popularity biases.
