  "description": "AFM stands for Attentional Factorization Machines. It Improves FM by discriminating the importance of different feature interactions, and learns the importance of each feature interaction from data via a neural attention network. Empirically, it is shown on regression task that AFM performs betters than FM with a 8.6% relative improvement, and consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art deep learning methods Wide&Deep and DeepCross with a much simpler structure and fewer model parameters.",
