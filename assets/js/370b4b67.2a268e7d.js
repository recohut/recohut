This generally leads to solutions that generalize better."),(0,r.kt)("p",null,"One of the most surprising results in statistics is Stein\u2019s paradox. Stein (1956) showed that it is better to estimate the means of three or more Gaussian random variables using samples from all of them rather than estimating them separately, even when the Gaussians are independent. Stein\u2019s paradox was an early motivation for multi-task learning (MTL) (Caruana, 1997), a learning paradigm in which data from multiple tasks is used with the hope to obtain superior performance over learning each task independently. Potential advantages of MTL go beyond the direct implications of Stein\u2019s paradox, since even seemingly unrelated real world tasks have strong dependencies due to the shared processes that give rise to the data. For example, although autonomous driving and object manipulation are seemingly unrelated, the underlying data is governed by the same laws of optics, material properties, and dynamics. This motivates the use of multiple tasks as an inductive bias in learning systems. A typical MTL system is given a collection of input points and sets of targets for various tasks per point. A common way to set up the inductive bias across tasks is to design a parametrized hypothesis class that shares some parameters across tasks. Typically, these parameters are learned by solving an optimization problem that minimizes a weighted sum of the empirical risk for each task. However, the linear-combination formulation is only sensible when there is a parameter set that is effective across all tasks. In other words, minimization of a weighted sum of empirical risk is only valid if tasks are not competing, which is rarely the case. MTL with conflicting objectives requires modeling of the trade-off between tasks, which is beyond what a linear combination achieves."),(0,r.kt)("p",null,"Multi-task learning is a machine learning method in which a model learns to solve multiple tasks simultaneously.
