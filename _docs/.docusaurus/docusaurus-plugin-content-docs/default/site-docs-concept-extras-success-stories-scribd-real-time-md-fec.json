  "description": "Transformer based model architecture can be applied to recommendation applications as well but recommendation problems are a bit more complex than NLP domain so it needs to be adapted according to the business needs. Therefore, instead of predicting next word based on the past sequence of words, at Scribd, we are interested in predicting what user would like to read next based on rich user interaction history with multiple types of documents and multiple types of interactions, where position in sequence & relative time are both important factors.",
