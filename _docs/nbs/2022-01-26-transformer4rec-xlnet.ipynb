In this example, the evaluation of the session-based recommendation model is performed using traditional Top-N ranking metrics such as Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG@20) and Hit Rate (HR@20). NDCG accounts for rank of the relevant item in the recommendation list and is a more fine-grained metric than HR, which only verifies whether the relevant item is among the top-n items. HR@n is equivalent to Recall@n when there is only one relevant item in the recommendation list."],"id":"612a5034"},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"5880612b"},"source":["# Instantiate the T4Rec Trainer, which manages training and evaluation for the PyTorch API\n","trainer = Trainer(\n","    model=model,\n","    args=train_args,\n","    schema=schema,\n","    compute_metrics=True,\n",")"],"id":"5880612b","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"5e839647"},"source":["- Define the output folder of the processed parquet files"],"id":"5e839647"},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"9ffbc397"},"source":["OUTPUT_DIR = os.environ.get(\"OUTPUT_DIR\", \"/workspace/data/sessions_by_day\")"],"id":"9ffbc397","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"1d5e98ae","outputId":"cf50855f-b7b5-4e99-d0c8-5fb501f13212"},"source":["start_time_window_index = 1\n","final_time_window_index = 7\n","#Iterating over days of one week\n","for time_index in range(start_time_window_index, final_time_window_index):\n","    # Set data \n","    time_index_train = time_index\n","    time_index_eval = time_index + 1\n","    train_paths = glob.glob(os.path.join(OUTPUT_DIR, f\"{time_index_train}/train.parquet\"))\n","    eval_paths = glob.glob(os.path.join(OUTPUT_DIR, f\"{time_index_eval}/valid.parquet\"))\n","    print(train_paths)\n","    \n","    # Train on day related to time_index \n","    print('*'*20)\n","    print(\"Launch training for day %s are:\" %time_index)\n","    print('*'*20 + '\\n')\n","    trainer.train_dataset_or_path = train_paths\n","    trainer.reset_lr_scheduler()\n","    trainer.train()\n","    trainer.state.global_step +=1\n","    print('finished')\n","    \n","    # Evaluate on the following day\n","    trainer.eval_dataset_or_path = eval_paths\n","    train_metrics = trainer.evaluate(metric_key_prefix='eval')\n","    print('*'*20)\n","    print(\"Eval results for day %s are:\\t\" %time_index_eval)\n","    print('\\n' + '*'*20 + '\\n')\n","    for key in sorted(train_metrics.keys()):\n","        print(\" %s = %s\" % (key, str(train_metrics[key]))) \n","    trainer.wipe_memory()"],"id":"1d5e98ae","execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["['/workspace/data/sessions_by_day/1/train.parquet']\n","********************\n","Launch training for day 1 are:\n","********************\n","\n"]},{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["***** Running training *****\n","  Num examples = 768\n","  Num Epochs = 5\n","  Instantaneous batch size per device = 256\n","  Total train batch size (w. parallel, distributed & accumulation) = 1024\n","  Gradient Accumulation steps = 1\n","  Total optimization steps = 15\n"]},{"data":{"text/html":["\n","    <div>\n","      \n","      <progress value='15' max='15' style='width:300px; height:20px; vertical-align: middle;'></progress>\n","      [15/15 00:00, Epoch 5/5]\n","    </div>\n","    <table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: left;\">\n","      <th>Step</th>\n","      <th>Training Loss</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table><p>"],"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.HTML object>"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["\n","\n","Training completed.
