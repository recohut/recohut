  "description": "The construction of effective Recommender Systems (RS) is a complex process, mainly due to the nature of RSs which involves large scale software-systems and human interactions. Iterative development processes require deep understanding of a current baseline as well as the ability to estimate the impact of changes in multiple variables of interest. Simulations are well suited to address both challenges and potentially leading to a high velocity construction process, a fundamental requirement in commercial contexts. Recently, there has been significant interest in RS Simulation Platforms, which allow RS developers to easily craft simulated environments where their systems can be analyzed.",
